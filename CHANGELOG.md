# Changelog

All notable changes to Codeless should be recorded in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project currently tracks changes in a lightweight, repository-oriented way.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- **Canonical Clean-Slate Tool Ecosystem (~17 Tools)**: Consolidated all remaining single-action and redundant tools into unified multi-action powerhouses with zero legacy alias baggage:
  - `file`: Unified file operations (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `notebook_edit`) with sandbox path boundary checking, ABB path virtualization, and approval diffs.
  - `agent`: Unified subagent orchestration (`spawn`, `message`, `status`, `stop`) merging subagent dispatch and stdin/swarm communication.
  - `task`: Unified background task management (`create`, `get`, `list`, `stop`, `output`, `update`, `sleep`) merging async processes and execution pausing.
  - `mcp`: Unified Model Context Protocol management (`list`, `read`, `auth`, `status`) merging resource inspection and credential persistence.
  - `image`: Unified multimodal vision tool (`describe`, `generate`) merging image understanding and raster generation.
  - `abb`: Unified Agent Buildable Base tool (`list`, `show`, `ready`, `blocked_by`, `verify`) merging DAG inspection and Two-Track test verification.
- **GOVERNANCE Mode Fully Merged into PLAN Mode**: Cleaned the operational architecture into 4 orthogonal modes (`AGENT`, `PLAN`, `ASK`, `CODEBASE`), removing all lingering `governance` aliases and tests.
- **PLAN Mode ABB Write Authority & Path Virtualization Fix**: Resolved project-root discovery and absolute/relative path virtualization in `is_abb_path` and `evaluate_write_permission`, ensuring full authority to read, write, and update all ABB documents (`STACK.md`, `agent.md`, `tasks/*`, `features/*`, `design/*`, `workflows/*`, `references/*`, `skills/*`, `assets/*`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`) in `PLAN` mode while keeping project code strictly read-only.
- **Python ≥3.12 CI Matrix Alignment**: Updated GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `autopilot-*.yml`) and `pyproject.toml` to target Python 3.12 and 3.13, deprecating legacy 3.10 and 3.11 CI runners.
- **Removed Deprecated Tools**: Completely purged `brief` tool and 30 obsolete tool source files.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Consolidated Multi-Action Tooling**: Consolidated fine-grained CRUD tools into lean, high-leverage multi-action tools (`cron`, `task`, `worktree`, `mcp_resource`, `web`) reducing tool count and token bloat by ~60%.
- **Action-Level Dynamic Permissions**: Enhanced `BaseTool.is_read_only(arguments)` to dynamically evaluate read-only vs mutating actions per-invocation. In `PLAN`, `ASK`, `CODEBASE`, and `GOVERNANCE` modes, read actions (`cron list`, `task get/list/output`, `worktree list`, `web crawl/search/fetch`) execute seamlessly without confirmation while mutating actions are gated.
- **Tool Registry Deduplication & Alias Separation**: Refactored `ToolRegistry` and `create_default_tool_registry()` to emit only primary consolidated tools into active LLM API schemas (~26 tools), eliminating redundant tool schemas while maintaining backward-compatible `.get()` access for legacy tools.
- **Unified Web Crawling & Search Engine**: High-performance structured web tool with HTML-to-Markdown distillation, metadata parsing, link discovery, CSS selector scoping, and Crawl4AI acceleration support.
- **Cold-Start Exploration & Template Choice**: Injected cold-start context assimilation protocol in ABB governance (`agent.md`, router) and runtime prompt composer (`context.py`), guiding autonomous agents on empty-history turns and asking users for open-source template strategy.
- **Async Response Stream Teardown**: Explicit try/finally stream closing on streaming completions preventing unhandled `httpcore2` generator exit tracebacks on Windows.
- **Zero-Error Ruff Quality Standard**: Configured automated Ruff linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, and format scripts across 370+ files.
- **Personal Creator Narrative**: Comprehensive README overhaul articulating the vision behind Codeless, ABB memory management, multi-harness interoperability, and SDLC tracking.
- **Package & Version 1.0.0 Consistency**: Unified all `/version` and `/upgrade` command handlers, CLI entry points, and User-Agent headers to `1.0.0`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Hooks now support a `priority` field (default `0`). Within an event, hooks run highest-priority first, and hooks sharing a priority keep their registration order. This lets users order, for example, a security-check hook ahead of a logging hook regardless of where each is declared in settings or contributed by plugins.
- `edit_file` and `write_file` in the React TUI now preview a unified diff before applying file changes, let users approve once or for the rest of the session, and skip the extra prompt automatically in `full_auto` mode.

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal screen flickering and cursor instability in the React TUI during interactive question prompts by replacing the animated waiting indicator interval with a static status label while user input is active.
- Codex subscription requests now pass reasoning effort separately, enabling `gpt-5.5` with `xhigh` effort instead of treating `gpt-5.5 xhigh` as an unsupported model name.
- Telegram channel now delivers replies again under `ohmo init --no-interactive` and other configs that do not write a `reply_to_message` field. `TelegramConfig` declares `reply_to_message: bool = True` so the attribute access in `TelegramChannel.send` no longer raises `AttributeError` and outbound progress/tool-hint/final messages are sent as expected. See issue #243.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added a bundled `skill-creator` skill for creating, improving, and verifying Codeless/ohmo skills.
- User-invocable skills can now be triggered directly as slash commands, with support for skill-specific arguments and model override metadata.

### Fixed

- `oh setup` can now update the API key for an already-configured API-key provider profile instead of only changing the model.
- `oh provider edit <profile> --api-key <key>` can now replace a saved profile API key, and `oh provider add ... --api-key <key>` can store one during profile creation.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Built-in `nvidia` provider profile so `oh setup` offers NVIDIA NIM as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider choice, with `NVIDIA_API_KEY` auth source, `openai/gpt-oss-120b` as the default model, and the NVIDIA NIM endpoint.
- Built-in `qwen` provider profile so `oh setup` offers Qwen (DashScope) as a first-class provider choice, with `dashscope_api_key` auth source, `qwen-plus` as the default model, and the DashScope OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Plugin tool discovery: plugins can now provide `BaseTool` subclasses in a `<plugin>/tools/` directory and they are auto-discovered, instantiated, and registered in the tool registry at runtime. Add `tools_dir` to `plugin.json` (defaults to `"tools"`).
- `oh --dry-run` safe preview mode for inspecting resolved runtime settings, auth state, prompt assembly, commands, skills, tools, and configured MCP servers without executing the model or tools.
- Built-in `minimax` provider profile so `oh setup` offers MiniMax as a first-class provider choice, with `MINIMAX_API_KEY` auth source, `MiniMax-M2.7` as the default model, and `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed` in the model picker.
- Docker as an alternative sandbox backend (`sandbox.backend = "docker"`) for stronger execution isolation with configurable resource limits, network isolation, and automatic image management.
- Built-in `gemini` provider profile so `oh setup` offers Google Gemini as a first-class provider choice, with `gemini_api_key` auth source and `gemini-2.5-flash` as the default model.
- `diagnose` skill: trace agent run failures and regressions using structured evidence from run artifacts.
- OpenAI-compatible API client (`--api-format openai`) supporting any provider that implements the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format, including Alibaba DashScope, DeepSeek, GitHub Models, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and more.
- `CODELESS_API_FORMAT` environment variable for selecting the API format.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback when using OpenAI-format providers.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for Python linting, tests, and frontend TypeScript checks.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with local setup, validation commands, and PR expectations.
- `docs/SHOWCASE.md` with concrete Codeless usage patterns and demo commands.
- GitHub issue templates and a pull request template.
- React TUI assistant messages now render structured Markdown blocks, including headings, lists, code fences, blockquotes, links, and tables.
- Built-in `codex` output style for compact, low-noise transcript rendering in React TUI.

### Fixed

- Subprocess teammate spawn (`agent` tool, `task_create`) now works on Windows under Git Bash. `subprocess_backend.spawn` builds a direct-exec `argv` list and passes it through new `argv=` and `env=` kwargs on `BackgroundTaskManager.create_agent_task` / `create_shell_task`; `_start_process` then runs the executable via `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(*argv)` with no shell in between. Previously the spawn command was a single string interpreted by `bash -lc`, which on Windows could not reliably exec a Windows-pathed Python interpreter (e.g. `C:\Users\...\python.exe`) — Git Bash's escape parser consumed the backslashes from the embedded env-prefix and, even with proper quoting, bash launched via `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` returned `command not found` for Windows-pathed binaries that worked perfectly when invoked interactively. Bypassing the shell sidesteps the entire class of cross-platform quoting and path-translation hazard. The legacy shell-evaluated `command=` path is preserved for callers (e.g. `BashTool`) that legitimately want shell semantics. See issue #230.
- Bundled skill loader now uses `yaml.safe_load` for SKILL.md frontmatter, matching the user-skill loader. The shared parser is extracted to `codeless.skills._frontmatter` so bundled and user skills handle YAML block scalars (`>`, `|`), quoted values, and other standard YAML constructs the same way.
- Compaction now detects llama.cpp/OpenAI-compatible context overflow errors, accounts for image blocks in auto-compact token estimates, and strips image payloads from summarizer-only compaction requests.
- Large tool results are now bounded in conversation history: oversized outputs are saved under `tool_artifacts`, old MCP results become microcompactable, and context collapse trims stale tool-result payloads.
- ohmo now keeps personal memory isolated from Codeless project memory: `/memory` in ohmo sessions targets the ohmo workspace memory store, and ohmo runtime prompt refreshes no longer inject project memory unless explicitly requested.
- Fixed `glob` and `grep` tools hanging indefinitely when the `rg` subprocess produced enough stderr output to fill the OS pipe buffer. `stderr` is now redirected to `DEVNULL` so it is discarded rather than blocking the child process.
- Fixed `bash_tool` hanging after a timed-out command when the subprocess stdout stream stayed open. `_read_remaining_output` now applies a 2-second `asyncio.wait_for` timeout so the tool always returns promptly.
- Fixed `session_runner` background task deadlock caused by an unread `stderr=PIPE` stream. The subprocess now uses `stderr=STDOUT` so all output merges into the single readable stdout pipe.
- React TUI prompt input now treats the raw DEL byte (`0x7f`) as backward delete while preserving true forward-delete escape sequences, fixing backspace failures seen in some macOS terminal environments.
- `todo_write` tool now updates an existing unchecked item in-place when `checked=True` instead of appending a duplicate `[x]` line.

- Built-in `Explore` and `claude-code-guide` agents no longer hard-code `model="haiku"`, which caused them to fail for users on non-Anthropic providers (OpenAI, Bedrock, custom base URLs, etc.). Both agents now use `model="inherit"` so they run with whatever model the parent session is using. `build_inherited_cli_flags` is also fixed to skip the `--model` flag entirely when the value is `"inherit"`, letting the subprocess correctly inherit the parent model via the `CODELESS_MODEL` environment variable instead of receiving the literal string `"inherit"` as a model name.

- React TUI spinner now stays visible throughout the entire agent turn: `assistant_complete` no longer resets `busy` state prematurely, and `tool_started` explicitly sets `busy=true` so the status bar remains active even when tool calls follow an assistant message. `line_complete` is the sole signal that ends the turn and clears the spinner.
- Skill loader now uses `yaml.safe_load` to parse SKILL.md frontmatter, correctly handling YAML block scalars (`>`, `|`), quoted values, and other standard YAML constructs instead of naive line-by-line splitting.
- `BackendHostConfig` was missing the `cwd` field, causing `AttributeError: 'BackendHostConfig' object has no attribute 'cwd'` on startup when `oh` was run after the runtime refactor that added `cwd` support to `build_runtime`.
- Shell-escape `$ARGUMENTS` substitution in command hooks to prevent shell injection from payload values containing metacharacters like `$(...)` or backticks.
- Swarm `_READ_ONLY_TOOLS` now uses actual registered tool names (snake_case) instead of PascalCase, fixing read-only auto-approval in `handle_permission_request`.
- Memory scanner now parses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`) instead of returning raw `---` as description.
- Memory search matches against body content in addition to metadata, with metadata weighted higher for relevance.
- Memory search tokenizer handles Han characters for multilingual queries.
- Fixed duplicate response in React TUI caused by double Enter key submission in the input handler.
- Fixed concurrent permission modals overwriting each other in TUI default mode when the LLM returns multiple tool calls in one response; `_ask_permission` now serialises callers via an `asyncio.Lock` so each modal is shown and resolved before the next one is emitted.
- Fixed React TUI Markdown tables to size columns from rendered cell text so inline formatting like code spans and bold text no longer breaks alignment.
- Fixed grep tool crashing with `ValueError` / `LimitOverrunError` when ripgrep outputs a line longer than 64 KB (e.g. minified assets or lock files). The asyncio subprocess stream limit is now 8 MB and oversized lines are skipped rather than terminating the session.
- Fixed React TUI exit leaving the shell prompt concatenated with the last TUI line. The terminal cleanup handler now writes a trailing newline (`\n`) alongside the cursor-show escape sequence so the shell prompt always starts on a fresh line.
- Reduced React TUI redraw pressure when `output_style=codex` by avoiding token-level assistant buffer flushes during streaming.

### Changed

- ohmo Feishu group routing now supports managed group creation, gateway-scoped provider/model commands, and stricter group mention handling so group conversations only wake ohmo when explicitly addressed.
- Dry-run output now reports a `ready` / `warning` / `blocked` readiness verdict, concrete `next_actions`, likely matching skills/tools for normal prompts, and richer slash-command previews for read-only vs stateful command paths.
- React TUI now groups consecutive `tool` + `tool_result` transcript rows into a single compound row: success shows the result line count inline (e.g. `→ 24L`), errors show a red icon and up to 5 lines of error detail beneath the tool row. Standalone successful tool results are suppressed to reduce transcript noise; standalone errors are still surfaced.
- README now links to contribution docs, changelog, showcase material, and provider compatibility guidance.
- README quick start now includes a one-command demo and clearer provider compatibility notes.
- README provider compatibility section updated to include OpenAI-format providers.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Install script now links `oh`, `ohmo`, and `codeless` into `~/.local/bin` instead of prepending the virtualenv `bin` directory to `PATH`, which avoids overriding Conda-managed shells while preserving global command discovery.
- React TUI prompt now supports `Shift+Enter` for inserting a newline without submitting the current prompt.
- React TUI busy-state animation is less error-prone on Windows terminals: the extra pseudo-animation line was removed, Windows now uses conservative ASCII spinner frames, and the spinner interval was slightly slowed to reduce flashing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Initial public release of Codeless.
- Core agent loop, tool registry, permission system, hooks, skills, plugins, MCP support, and terminal UI.
